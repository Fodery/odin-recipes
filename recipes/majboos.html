        <h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, take care of browning the chicken. To do this, place two tablespoons of oil in a large non-stick pan, heat it and then add the chicken. Brown on both sides for 2-3 minutes, so as to brown it well. Then set the chicken aside.</li>
<li>Add butter Ghee, or traditional butter, chopped onions, chillies, garlic, grated ginger to the pan that is always on the fire. Mix well and then saut√© for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Then add the baharat and turmeric and mix well.</li>
<li>At this point, put the chicken back in the pot and add the black lime. It is important to make sure that the black lime is pierced on the surface with the help of a sharp knife. In this way the juices will penetrate inside and it will release its sour and slightly smoky aroma.</li>
<li>Then add the tomatoes cut into small pieces, cardamom, cinnamon, a pinch of salt and the broth.</li>
<li>Mix well and then cover with the lid, lowering the heat. Cook for an hour over low heat, turning the chicken from time to time.</li>
<li>Meanwhile wash and dry the parsley and then chop it. There is no need to chop it too finely.</li>
<li>Also wash the basmati rice under water, until it is transparent and then drain it in a colander.</li>
<li>After cooking time, add the rice and parsley to your Machboos. Then cook in a covered saucepan for another 10-15 minutes.</li>
<li>Uncover and cook until the rice is cooked and the broth is almost completely evaporated. Decide when to discover the pan, according to the liquid that is still present. It is not always the same, in fact there are more or less watery tomatoes and types of rice with different absorption levels.</li>
<li>Finally, serve hot, adding a few more basil leaves and a few slices of fresh lime.</li>
        </ol>
